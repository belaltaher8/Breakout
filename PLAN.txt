-One variant of breakout that you thought was interesting: I thought
	the circus variant of the game was interesting because,
	as someone who has been playing games for a while, the fact
	that the paddle is now a seesaw seems to be the most 
	game-changing version of the original breakout game. I feel
	this way because it causes the player to consider angles
	in a way that no other breakout game requires. This inspired 
	my version of the breakout game which will include a rotating
	paddle. Having a paddle that doesn't stay still adds a 
	whole new aspect of challenge and gameplay, which makes it 
	more interesting to play and code.

-General description of levels: The levels will all be structured
	similarly. They will all contain a bunch of blocks at the top
	of the screen with the paddle at the bottom. The second level and
	third level, however, will cause the ball to move differently
	depending on where it hits the side walls. For example, a large
	section of the third level's side walls will cause the ball to
	speed up a lot, which will make the game harder. Meanwhile, 
	small sections of the side wall will slow the ball down. 
	Besides the side walls changing, there won't be much change
	between the levels besides what actual blocks are in the 
	conglomerate at the top of the screen. 

-Different kinds of blocks: 
	-One block will cover the ball with a "goo" that will 
			make it immediately fall straight down 
			(loses all momentum)
	-One block will explode, destroying all adjacent blocks
	-One block will cause 3 more balls to spawn all going
			in different directions
	-One block will drop a random powerup
	-One type of block for each power up
	-One block will, if broken first, destroy all adjacent
			blocks and all blocks adjacent to those originally
			adjacent ones

-Different power ups:
	-Speed up will increase speed of ball
	-Slow down will decrease speed of ball
	-Fire will make ball instantly break the next block it hits
	-Triple fire will make block break next 3 blocks 
	-Star power will make block immune to border effects
		*mentioned in general description of levels*

-Different cheat keys:
	-Cheat key for permanent star power
	-Cheat key for permanent fire
	-Cheat key that makes ball break into 3 whenever it hits a block

-Extra: The game won't appear much differently than the regular
	breakout game, but I believe that all the aspects of gameplay
	I'm introducing will make it a challenging yet enjoyable 
	take on the original breakout game.
