# Breakout
## Description
In this project, I recreated the popular Breakout game. This rendition functions very similarly to the original except the user can rotate the paddle using the up and down arrow keys which adds a dimension to the gameplay. Depending on the block destroyed/color of the wall hit by the ball, the ball will undergo different changes in its speed/power.


## Controls
* Left arrow key -> move left
* Right arrow key -> move right
* Up arrow key-> Rotate clockwise
* Down arrow key -> Rotate counterclockwise
