Hours: 20 hours
Roles: Belal did everything
Online resources: Google, Rectangle API, ImageView 
                  API, JavaFX API
Files used to start: Boiler-plate code (Lab_bounce)
Files used to test: Breakout.Java
Resource files: Used lab_bounce image files and paint
                to edit the images
Information: Left arrow key -> move left
             Right arrow key -> move right
             Up -> Rotate clockwise
             Down -> Rotate counterclockwise
             A -> advance to next level
             F -> Activate fire power
             S -> Slow ball down
             *Notice that the color of the wall
             effects what it does to the bouncer
             when the bouncher hits said wall*
             red -> slow down ball
             green -> speed up ball
             black -> nothing
             blue brick -> normal
             yellow arrow brick -> speed up
             red arrow brick -> slow down
             GOO brick -> loses all horizontal 
                          momentum
                          
 Impression: The project helped me have a much
             better grasp on JavaFX. I feel like
             most of the actual project was just 
             improving my sense of logic and coding
             ability. I think where I really 
             benefitted though was with the 
             refactoring. This taught my about the
             importance of having flexible code
             and taking advantage of the 
             compartmentalization required for
             good object oriented code.
